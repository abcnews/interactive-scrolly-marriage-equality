                <p>Polling consistently shows a majority of Australians support same-sex marriage â€” but opinions vary a lot
                    depending where you live.</p><a name="endheader"> </a>
                <p>A year ago, the ABC's Vote Compass asked Australians whether they agreed or disagreed with this statement:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Marriage should only be between a man and a woman</em>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>More than 1.2 million Australians responded, and a majority of people indicated support for same-sex marriage.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Yes, this data is 12 months old, but it remains the most detailed nationwide snapshot of voters' views
                        on same-sex marriage.</li>
                    <li>Recent evidence suggests <a href="/news/mobile/2017-08-02/hilda-survey-marriage-equality-same-sex/8763124"
                            target="_self" title="">Australian opinion on same-sex marriage</a> is only moving in one direction.</li>
                    <li>Typical polls don't have a big enough sample size to provide data on a seat-by-seat basis. <strong>Vote Compass does</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So let's see what that views look like around the country.</p>

                <a name="scrollyteller"> </a><a name="mark"> </a><p>On this map, every electorate is shaded based on voters' support for same-sex marriage: <strong>blue seats </strong>are less supportive and <strong>orange seats </strong>are more supportive.</p><p>A quick look at the colouring reveals that, even in most of rural and regional Australia, a majority of voters support same-sex marriage.</p><p>But this bird's eye view doesn't tell the full story â€” it over-emphasises a handful of large regional electorates, while the much smaller seats in our big population centres remain basically invisible.</p><a name="markELECTORATEsydneyZOOM20"> </a><p>Take Sydney, for instance. It's home to approximately one in every five Australians â€” meaning this grouping of electorates represents more people than the large rural seats that dominated the previous view.</p><a name="markELECTORATEsydneyANDchifleyZOOM20"> </a><p>A number of inner-Sydney suburbs register about 80 per cent support for same-sex marriage, among the strongest in the country, while the middle ring and western suburbs are around 50 per cent support.</p><a name="markELECTORATEwentworthANDparkesZOOM3"> </a><p>"There's a distinct 'inner city versus the rest' pattern," explains political scientist Shaun Ratcliff. "Outer-suburban areas and rural areas tend to be more conservative on this issue."</p><p>And this isn't just about Sydney. The pattern is the same nationwide: the closer you live to the inner city, the more likely you are to support same-sex marriage.</p><a name="markELECTORATEbrisbaneZOOM25"> </a><p>You can see the same pattern clearly in Brisbane, where the four seats closest to the CBD register support of 60 to 70 per cent, while surrounding suburbs are closer to the 50 per cent mark.</p><p>One of the most striking things about this geographic pattern is it appears to be stronger than any link to party support. </p><a name="markELECTORATEgriffithANDbrisbaneANDryanANDlilleyZOOM50"> </a><p>Of those four inner-Brisbane seats that are most supportive of same-sex marriage, the Liberal National Party holds two and Labor holds two.</p><a name="markELECTORATEfordeANDrankinANDblairZOOM35"> </a><p>Similarly, the suburban seats where support drops to about the 50 per cent mark also elect a mix of LNP and Labor MPs.</p><p>"It doesn't matter which party represents the electorate, the geography seems to matter more," Dr Ratcliff says, noting you see the same pattern across the country.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmaranoaZOOM1"> </a><p>Once you zoom out from Brisbane, it becomes clear that Queensland is our most conservative state on this issue. In fact, the five electorates with the lowest support for same-sex marriage are all in Queensland.</p><p>At the top of that list is Maranoa, which has a reputation as the most conservative seat in the country. Even here, the picture is mixed: 42 per cent of voters back same-sex marriage, compared to 44 per cent who are opposed (leaving 14 per cent 'neutral').</p><a name="markELECTORATEmelbourneportsZOOM10"> </a><p>At the other end of the spectrum is Victoria, which is considered Australia's most socially progressive state.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmelbourneportsZOOM40"> </a><p>In Melbourne, the most supportive seats are almost 80 per cent in favour, and every seat in the state is above 50 per cent support.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmenziesZOOM40"> </a><p>But this is where another pattern emerges from the data: "Parliament has been more conservative on this issue than the electorate," Dr Ratcliff says. "Every survey I've seen since 2007 has had majority support for same-sex marriage."</p><p>The electorate of Menzies is one example of this dichotomy. Here, about 60 per cent of voters indicated support for same-sex marriage. But the local MP, Liberal Kevin Andrews, remains one its most steadfast opponents.</p><a name="markELECTORATEwarringahZOOM40"> </a><p>We see the same, most famously, in Tony Abbott's seat of Warringah, where the former PM is a vocal campaigner for the 'no' cause, but voters in his electorate are broadly in favour.</p><p>And in Andrew Hastie.</p><a name="markELECTORATEdenisonZOOM15"> </a><p>The pattern remains the same in Tasmania, where the Hobart-based seat of Denison is the state's most supportive of same-sex marriage.</p><a name="markELECTORATEadelaideZOOM25"> </a><p>It also holds true in Adelaide...</p><a name="markELECTORATEperth"> </a><p>In Perth.</p><a name="markELECTORATEsolomonAndlingiariZOOM5"> </a><p>And in Darwin.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmcmahonANDchifleyZOOM50"> </a><p>Returning to Sydney for the moment, one of the striking things about this geographic pattern is it appears to be stronger than any link to party support. So the Sydney seats that are least supportive of same-sex marriage include a number of Labor-held electorates, while...</p><a name="markELECTORATEwentworthANDwarringahANDnorthsydneyZOOM50"> </a><p>A number of the most supportive seats in the inner city are held by Liberal MPs.</p><p>"It doesn't matter which party represents the electorate, the geography seems to matter more," explains Dr Ratcliff.</p><p>And these trends are not just about Sydney. As we'll see, the pattern is the same nationwide: the closer you live to the inner city, the more likely you are to support same-sex marriage.</p><p>But for the moment, let's stay in Australia's biggest city. It provides a microcosm for one other trend that also translates across the country.</p><a name="markELECTORATEwarringahZOOM50"> </a><p>That trend is that Parliament has been, and remains, more conservative on the issue of same-sex marriage than the electorate at large.</p><p>Nowhere is this clearer than in Warringah, where 66 per cent of voters indicated support for allowing same-sex couples to marry. But the local member has a different view. This is Tony Abbott's seat, and despite the views of his electorate, he is a leading voice for the 'no' campaign.</p><p>Secondly, one of the defining trends of Australian politics holds true here: Queensland is our most conservative state and Victoria is the most progressive.</p><p>But to get the whole story, and see what we can really learn from this map, we need to take a deeper look around the country.</p><p>But it's not just Sydney â€” the pattern is the same in all our capital cities.</p><p>The inner-city, including a number of Liberal-held electorates, has the strongest level of support, which slips to about 50 per cent in a number of seats in the western suburbs, including a number held by Labor.</p><p>"It doesn't matter which party represents the electorate, the geography seems to matter more," Dr Ratcliff notes.</p><a name="markELECTORATEwentworthZOOM30"> </a><p>In Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's seat, Wentworth, a large majority of 76 per cent of voters indicated support for same-sex marriage.</p><p>Mr Turnbull is encouraging Australians to vote 'yes' in the planned postal survey.</p><a name="markELECTORATEwarringahANDwentworthZOOM30"> </a><p>In the neighbouring electorate of Warringah, 66 per cent of voters expressed support for allowing same-sex couples to marry. But the local member here holds a different view.</p><p>This is former prime minister Tony Abbott's seat, and he is a leading advocate for the 'no' campaign.</p><a name="markELECTORATEleichhardtZOOM3"> </a><p>One of the strongest Liberal voices backing same-sex marriage under both Mr Turnbull's and Mr Abbott's watch has been Queenslander Warren Entsch.</p><p>About half of voters in Mr Entsch's north Queensland seat indicated their support for same-sex marriage, compared to 39 per cent who said marriage should be only between a man and a woman.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmaranoaZOOM3"> </a><p>Elsewhere in regional Queensland is the seat where voters are the least supportive of same-sex marriage out of anywhere in the nation, Maranoa.</p><p>But even here support for same-sex marriage is 32 per cent, while 54 per cent of voters say marriage should be only between a man and a woman.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmaranoaANDkennedyandflynnandgroomZOOM2"> </a><p>Out of the 10 seats in Australia with the lowest support for same-sex marriage, seven are in Queensland.</p><a name="markELECTORATEbrisbaneANDgriffithandryanZOOM30"> </a><p>But again, in the inner-city, it's another story. The Member for Brisbane, Trevor Evans, was a high-profile voice alongside Mr Entsch in pushing for the Liberal party room to change its position.</p><p>A majority of voters in Mr Evans's seat back his view.</p><a name="markELECTORATEfordeANDdicksonandblairZOOM15"> </a><p>But support is not as strong in Brisbane's middle and outer suburbs. Forde, south of the city, is one of the 10 suburbs most opposed to same-sex marriage in the country.</p><a name="markELECTORATEbatmanZOOM20"> </a><p>To find the seat with the strongest backing for same-sex marriage in Australia, we need to head out of Queensland and take a look at Melbourne.</p><p>Labor MP David Feeney's seat of Batman is the most pro-SSM seat in the country, with 79 per cent of voters indicating their support. Only 15 per cent here say marriage should be only between a man and a woman.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmelbourneANDwillsZOOM20"> </a><p>Again, that's in line with Victoria's position as Australia's most politically progressive state â€” seven of the top 10 seats in favour of same-sex marriage are in Victoria.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmaribyrnongZOOM20"> </a><p>Opposition Leader Bill Shorten's seat, Maribyrnong, is not on that top 10 list but a clear majority of voters back his position in support of same-sex marriage.</p><a name="markELECTORATElyonsANDdenisonZOOM5"> </a><p>In Tasmania, city areas are again the strongest supporters of same-sex marriage.</p><a name="markELECTORATElyonsANDbraddonZOOM5"> </a><p>In Braddon, 46 per cent of voters indicate they're opposed to same-sex marriage, compared to 43 per cent in support.</p><a name="markELECTORATEadelaideZOOM20"> </a><p>The geographic trends holds up in South Australia too, with the inner-city broadly in support.</p><a name="markELECTORATEwakefieldANDgreyandadelaideZOOM2"> </a><p>And regional areas less supportive, with the seat of Grey among the country's 10 seats least supportive of same-sex marriage.</p><a name="markELECTORATEperth"> </a><p>And Perth.</p><a name="markELECTORATElingiariANDsolomonZOOM2"> </a><p>Darwin is less clear because of the small number of NT seats.</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a>

                <p><strong>Just some notes</strong></p>
                <p>Warren Entsch is the Member for Leichhardt. Pushing the same-sex agenda for the Liberals. His seat is split
                    down the middle on the issue.</p>
                <p>Entsch was one of 5 pushing for a free vote. Dean Smith (Senator), Trent Zimmerman (North Sydney, 66%), Trevor
                    Evans (Brisbane 67%), Tim Wilson (Goldstein, 70%)</p>
                <p>Of the 10 seats most opposed to same-sex marriage, 7 are in Queensland. Barker and Grey in SA, plus Parkes
                    in NSW</p>
